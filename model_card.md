# 🎧 Model Card: Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name  

Give your model a short, descriptive name.  
Example: **VibeFinder 1.0**  

---

## 2. Intended Use  

Describe what your recommender is designed to do and who it is for. 

Prompts:  

- What kind of recommendations does it generate  
- What assumptions does it make about the user  
- Is this for real users or classroom exploration  

---

## 3. How the Model Works  

The recommender compares every song in the catalog to a simple taste profile (favorite genre, favorite mood, and a target energy level) and gives each song a score out of about 5 points.

- A song earns **2 points** if its genre matches the user's favorite genre and **1 point** if its mood matches.
- For energy, the song earns up to **2 points** based on how *close* its energy is to the user's target. A song with exactly the target energy gets the full 2 points, and the further away it is, the fewer points it gets. Higher energy is not automatically better.
- If the profile also includes a target valence (how positive the song sounds) or a preference for acoustic music, closeness on those earns up to 1 extra point each.

Every point is recorded with a short reason, such as "genre match (+2.0)", so each recommendation can be explained. The songs are then sorted from highest to lowest score and the top few are shown. The scoring step judges one song at a time, and the ranking step puts all the judged songs in order.

Avoid code here. Pretend you are explaining the idea to a friend who does not program.

## 4. Data  

Describe the dataset the model uses.  

Prompts:  

- How many songs are in the catalog  
- What genres or moods are represented  
- Did you add or remove data  
- Are there parts of musical taste missing in the dataset  

---

## 5. Strengths  

Where does your system seem to work well  

Prompts:  

- User types for which it gives reasonable results  
- Any patterns you think your scoring captures correctly  
- Cases where the recommendations matched your intuition  

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias 

Where the system struggles or behaves unfairly. 

Prompts:  

- Features it does not consider  
- Genres or moods that are underrepresented  
- Cases where the system overfits to one preference  
- Ways the scoring might unintentionally favor some users  

---

## 7. Evaluation  

How you checked whether the recommender behaved as expected. 

Prompts:  

- Which user profiles you tested  
- What you looked for in the recommendations  
- What surprised you  
- Any simple tests or comparisons you ran  

No need for numeric metrics unless you created some.

---

## 8. Future Work  

Ideas for how you would improve the model next.  

Prompts:  

- Additional features or preferences  
- Better ways to explain recommendations  
- Improving diversity among the top results  
- Handling more complex user tastes  

---

## 9. Personal Reflection  

A few sentences about your experience.  

Prompts:  

- What you learned about recommender systems  
- Something unexpected or interesting you discovered  
- How this changed the way you think about music recommendation apps
